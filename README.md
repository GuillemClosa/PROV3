# PROV3
This repository contains the documents mentioned in the article "W3C PROV to describe provenance at dataset, feature and attribute level". It is composed by three folders and two files.  
-->ISOGML folder:
Contains 6 files which documents the provenance at dataset, feature and attribute level, derived from a very simple example of WPS conflation execution using  ISO and GML. 
-->W3CPROV folder:
Is W3CPROV document which describes provenance at dataset, feature and attribute level derived from a very simple example of WPS conflation execution using  W3C PROV in RDF.    
-->W3CPROVGML folder:
Is the combination of the GML and W3CPROV to describe provenance at dataset, feature and attribute level. The W3CPROV document is serialized in XML and describes the dataset level, and the GML has the feature and attribute level.
-->model
Describes the Provenance ontology model in Notation (N3) serialization to describe the provenance in W3C-PROV provenance in RDF derived from WPS conflation execution between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) dataset with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).  .
serialization in https://github.com/GuillemClosa/PROV3/model.
-->prov: 
Provenance derived from the WPS conflation execution.
